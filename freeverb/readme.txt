Freeverb - By Jezar at Dreampoint (http://www.dreampoint.co.uk)
===============================================================


Welcome to FREE professional-quality reverb at last!
----------------------------------------------------
It is already possible to get Professional Digital Multitrack with Automated Digital Mixing, along with top-notch, plug-in digital effects on your desktop computer at little cost.

What frustrated me though, is the fact that it seemed impossible to buy professional quality reverb for a decent price from anyone - let alone get it for free! Getting a good reverb for any audio package, from the various online sources, could literally cost hundreds of dollars!

I wanted to adopt the same community spirit as the author of shareware multitrack applications, and make high-quality audio tools available at little or no cost to desktop computer users, and the result is this - "Freeverb" - the worlds first true studio-quality reverb available completely for free.

Freeverb generates beautifully smooth reverb tails on any signal from drums to vocals. Even when using the smallest "Room size", the reverb is still soft and pure and does not "splatter" like even certain commercial units do!

And best of all, Freeverb is completely FREE. It does not cost you a penny. Please feel free to distribute Freeverb to all your friends. You may distribute it any way you see fit, provided that you only distribute the original archive file with this readme document intact and unaltered.

Visit http://www.dreampoint.co.uk to make sure you have the latest version!


HOW TO USE FREEVERB
-------------------
Place Freeverb.component into Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/
That can be in your user Library folder or in your root Library folder.



USING FREEVERB
--------------
Once you have loaded up Freeverb into your audio software, then simply use "Room size" to get the size of the room you want, and use the "Wet level" and "Dry level" controls to balance the reverb as you see fit. "Damping" controls the simulated "absorbency" of the room, and the "Highpass" and "Lowpass" controls just allow you to tailor the sound to your personal taste and requirements. "Predelay" allows you to create a reverb that arrives some time after the original sound - good for simulating "back wall" effects or simply to make vocals sound more sparkly and guitar solos more interesting.

That's it!
